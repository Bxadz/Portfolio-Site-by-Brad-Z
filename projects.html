            <p>
                Within this module, we have been assigned to create a Figma-based website, and
                by that, I mean designing a 3-page website using grids and different size frames
                for different devices. This task also requires us to test the responsibility to
                ensure that no matter the size of the screen, the contents can be transferred smoothly.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="project">
            <img src="images/composition 2.png" alt="Symmetrical Composition">
            <p>
                On this page as seen above, are 3 graphic compositions that we were tasked to
                create independently, and with that, you can see that I have incorporated a
                Spatial Composition, a Symmetrical composition, and a Radial composition —
                all created by using the Pen and the shape tools.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="project">
            <img src="images/composition 3.png" alt="Radial Composition">
            <p>
                With the creation of these compositions, it allows those who may preview my site
                in the future to see just a small percentage of my individually created work.
                This website will implement the use of HTML, and a Bootstrap CSS for accessibility
                across the different platforms one may use.
