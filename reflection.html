    Welcome reader, upon this page will be my post-creation reflection,
    which as per the brief should only be a MAX of 500 words. One thing
    to note is, as this is simply an explanation as to what I’m about to
    write, it will not count towards the word count and instead will be
    a preliminary header to it.

      To reflect on the project/assignment, I must firstly say it was not easy by any means. But with that, came the opportunity to improve upon the skills I already had just as well as implement new things that I had learned across the first semester.
      With that being said tho, I did enjoy this project as it really made me take into consideration the different aspects and ratios for the different everyday devices that we as people use. as a not-so experienced Figma user, It was nice to discover that software like that exists, and 
      when correctly implemented, works a treat. The major things that I myself need to improve on really, is Time/Asset Management as I believe that if I had given myself more time, this project could have been more elaborate.
