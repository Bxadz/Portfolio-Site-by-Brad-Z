  <p>Welcome, this is the beginning of my portfolio site. My name is Brad Zinyama, I am a 23 Year old 1st year Digital Media student at The University of the West of England. I am hoping to potentially dive into the more cybernetic side of media later within my tenure, but within this first year, we as students have been assigned to complete 4 Modules with this one being Graphic and Web Design studio.</p>

  <p>Whilst this is my first official year as a Digital Media student, it’s important to note that I have some form of prior experience due to me being enrolled and completing a foundation year, which gave me the opportunity to get some coding down as well as gain a basic understanding for the potentially different coding languages that can/would be implemented throughout my time on the course.</p>
